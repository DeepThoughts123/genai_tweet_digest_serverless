# GenAI Twitter Account Discovery Strategies

## Overview

This document outlines three complementary strategies for discovering high-quality Twitter accounts in the Generative AI domain. The goal is to build and maintain a dynamic list of 200-300 accounts for regular content monitoring and summarization.

**Target Outcome**: A curated list that captures the breadth and depth of GenAI discourse, from cutting-edge research to practical applications, ensuring comprehensive coverage for professional AI researchers and GenAI hobbyists alike.

## üéØ Core Challenge

**The Problem**: The GenAI landscape is vast and rapidly evolving. Manually curating 200-300 high-quality accounts is time-consuming and prone to bias. We need systematic, scalable approaches that can:

- Discover accounts across different GenAI specializations
- Identify both established authorities and emerging voices  
- Capture viral content from accounts outside our core list
- Adapt to the evolving GenAI ecosystem over time

**Our Solution**: Three complementary discovery strategies that work together to provide comprehensive coverage.

## üìä Strategy A: Graph-Based Discovery

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Fully Implemented** (see `/graph_base/` folder)

### Core Concept
"**Who follows whom reveals expertise and relevance.**"

If Andrew Ng follows someone, they're likely relevant to AI. If multiple tier-1 researchers follow the same person, that's a very strong signal. This strategy leverages the wisdom of crowds in professional networks.

### How It Works

#### 1. **Seed Account Classification**
- Start with 10-20 known high-quality accounts (Andrew Ng, OpenAI, DeepMind, etc.)
- Classify into tiers based on authority:
  - **Tier 1**: Academic institutions and research labs
  - **Tier 2**: Major tech companies with AI focus
  - **Tier 3**: GenAI practitioners and commentators

#### 2. **Following Network Expansion**
- Extract "following" lists from each seed account
- Apply quality filters to remove spam, crypto traders, and irrelevant accounts
- Weight relationships based on source account tier (Tier 1 follows carry more weight)

#### 3. **Graph Analysis**
- Build a weighted network where nodes = accounts, edges = following relationships
- Calculate network metrics (centrality, influence, connectivity)
- Identify accounts followed by multiple high-tier sources

#### 4. **Community Detection**
- Use algorithms to find clusters of related accounts
- Identify specialized sub-communities (AI safety, computer vision, NLP, etc.)
- Find "bridge" accounts that connect different specialization areas

### Key Advantages
- **High precision**: Following relationships are intentional, indicating genuine relevance
- **Authority weighting**: Endorsements from top-tier accounts carry more weight
- **Community structure**: Reveals hidden specialization areas and ecosystem structure
- **Scalable**: Algorithms can process thousands of relationships efficiently

### What We Discovered
- Perfect for finding established experts and rising stars
- Excellent at revealing community structure in GenAI ecosystem
- Identifies strategic "bridge" accounts that connect different specializations
- Works well with API rate limits through intelligent sampling

## üîç Strategy B: Content-Based Discovery

**Status**: üìã **Conceptualized** (see `/content_base/` folder for future implementation)

### Core Concept
"**Content quality and relevance indicate expertise.**"

Analyze what people actually say about GenAI topics. High-quality content creators often demonstrate deep understanding through their tweets, regardless of their follower count or network position.

### How It Would Work

#### 1. **Bio and Profile Analysis**
- Search for accounts with GenAI keywords in their bios
- Analyze profile information for institutional affiliations
- Look for expertise indicators (PhD, publications, project links)
- Cross-reference with academic databases when possible

#### 2. **Tweet Content Similarity**
- Use natural language processing to analyze tweet content
- Find accounts whose content is semantically similar to known experts
- Identify accounts discussing cutting-edge GenAI topics
- Weight by content depth and technical sophistication

#### 3. **Hashtag and Topic Analysis**
- Track accounts using relevant hashtag combinations
- Monitor discussion threads around major GenAI announcements
- Identify accounts contributing valuable insights to trending topics
- Map topic coverage to ensure breadth across GenAI domains

#### 4. **Publication and Link Analysis**
- Track accounts sharing high-quality research papers
- Identify accounts linked to from academic publications
- Monitor accounts sharing original research or code repositories
- Analyze the quality and relevance of shared content

### Key Advantages
- **Captures emerging voices**: New experts who haven't built large networks yet
- **Content-focused**: Values insight over popularity
- **Topic coverage**: Ensures discussion of all GenAI areas
- **Real-time discovery**: Can identify accounts discussing breaking developments

### Use Cases
- Finding researchers who publish but aren't well-connected socially
- Discovering international experts outside English-speaking networks
- Identifying practitioners sharing valuable implementation insights
- Capturing accounts focused on niche but important GenAI topics

## ‚ö° Strategy C: Engagement-Based Discovery

**Status**: üìã **Conceptualized** (see `/engagement_base/` folder for future implementation)

### Core Concept
"**High-quality engagement reveals thoughtful contributors.**"

Look beyond follower counts to find accounts that generate meaningful discussions, provide insightful commentary, and contribute valuable perspectives to GenAI conversations.

### How It Would Work

#### 1. **Reply and Discussion Mining**
- Analyze reply threads under major GenAI announcements
- Identify accounts providing insightful commentary or corrections
- Find accounts that start or contribute to high-quality technical discussions
- Weight by the quality of responses they receive from established experts

#### 2. **Quote Tweet Analysis**
- Monitor accounts that add valuable commentary when quote tweeting
- Identify accounts that provide context, criticism, or insights on shared content
- Track accounts whose quote tweets get engagement from established experts
- Analyze the depth and quality of added commentary

#### 3. **Viral Content Capture**
- Monitor GenAI-related tweets that achieve high engagement
- Identify accounts behind viral GenAI content (tutorials, explanations, commentary)
- Track accounts whose content gets reshared by established experts
- Analyze content that bridges technical concepts for broader audiences

#### 4. **Cross-Platform Validation**
- Check if accounts are referenced in academic papers or blog posts
- Look for accounts mentioned in podcasts or conference talks
- Validate expertise through external recognition or citations
- Track accounts building notable projects or tools

### Key Advantages
- **Quality over quantity**: Values thoughtful contribution over follower count
- **Real-time relevance**: Captures accounts responding to current developments
- **Diverse perspectives**: Finds voices that might be overlooked by other methods
- **Viral capture**: Ensures coverage of broadly impactful content

### Use Cases
- Finding educators who excel at explaining complex concepts
- Discovering critics who provide valuable counter-perspectives
- Identifying builders creating useful GenAI tools or applications
- Capturing accounts that surface important but overlooked developments
