# Current Project Status & Next Steps

**Date:** June 7, 2025

This document provides a snapshot of the GenAI Tweet Digest project, including the progress made on the new tweet classification feature, the outstanding issues, and a recommended path forward for the next developer.

### Progress to Date

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive, end-to-end pipeline for fetching, analyzing, and storing tweets. The key accomplishments include:

1.  **Full-Featured Data Model:** A robust, traceable data model has been designed and implemented to capture a rich set of information for each tweet, including:
    *   Full OCR text and AI-generated summaries.
    *   L1 and L2 classification results.
    *   Engagement metrics, tweet type, and author information.
    *   Traceability for the AI models used in each step.

2.  **Modular, Test-Driven Services:** The pipeline has been built using a modular, service-oriented architecture, with a strong emphasis on unit testing. The key services include:
    *   `TweetFetcher`: For retrieving tweets from the Twitter API.
    *   `VisualTweetCaptureService`: For capturing screenshots, performing OCR, and generating summaries.
    *   `HierarchicalClassifier`: for classifying tweets.
    *   `ClassifierService`: For orchestrating the classification process.

3.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The entire AWS infrastructure is defined as code using the AWS CDK. This includes:
    *   An SQS queue for decoupling the pipeline components.
    *   A DynamoDB table with a GSI for storing the final results.
    *   An S3 bucket for storing screenshots.
    *   A Fargate service for running the classification process.

4.  **Comprehensive Local Testing:** A full suite of unit and integration tests has been developed, allowing for thorough local testing of the entire pipeline without requiring a full AWS deployment.

### Resolved Issues

*   **Issue:** The Fargate service was not correctly processing messages from the SQS queue due to a `ModuleNotFoundError`.
*   **Resolution:** The issue was traced to an incorrect Docker build configuration. The `Dockerfile` was copying the `src` directory to `/app/src` while the `PYTHONPATH` was set to `/app`. This prevented the Python interpreter from locating the modules. The fix involved changing the `Dockerfile` to copy the *contents* of `src` directly into the `/app` directory (`COPY src/ .`) and adjusting the entrypoint to `fargate.async_runner`. This aligns the container's file structure with the `PYTHONPATH`, resolving the import errors.

*   **Issue:** The Fargate task was failing with a cascade of `ModuleNotFoundError` issues for packages like `tweepy`, `webdriver_manager`, and `PIL`.
*   **Resolution:** The root cause was a set of missing dependencies in `requirements.txt`. While `tweepy` was present, its usage of `selenium` for visual tweet capture introduced transitive dependencies that were not explicitly listed. The issue was resolved by iteratively testing the Docker container locally (`docker run ... python -m fargate.async_runner`) and adding the following missing packages to `requirements.txt`: `selenium`, `webdriver-manager`, and `Pillow`. This local debugging cycle allowed for rapid identification and resolution of dependency issues before deploying to the cloud.

### Quick Start for the Next Developer

With the primary dependency issues resolved, the next step is to ensure the fix is deployed correctly to the cloud.

### ✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!

The GenAI Tweet Classification pipeline is now successfully deployed and running on AWS Fargate!

**Infrastructure Details:**
- **SQS Queue URL**: `https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/855450210814/ClassifierStack-ClassificationQueueEEAC6F55-5wEAB6cca8te`
- **DynamoDB Table**: `ClassifierStack-TweetTopicsTableD9CB57C4-1A8FFGIVK5AJ2`
- **S3 Bucket**: `classifierstack-tweetscreenshotbucketb280f4b5-utgkcgleaevv`
- **ECS Cluster**: `ClassifierStack-ClassifierCluster3B5A8E18-NTkykRVbVDF1`
- **Container Status**: RUNNING (as of June 8, 2025, 8:29 PM EST)

### Testing the Pipeline

Now that the infrastructure is deployed and running, you can test the end-to-end pipeline:

1. **Send a Test Message to SQS**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/genai_tweet_digest_serverless
   export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src:$PYTHONPATH
   python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --accounts elonmusk --max 5
   ```

2. **Monitor the Processing**:
   - Check CloudWatch logs for the Fargate service
   - Query DynamoDB to see classified tweets
   - Check S3 for stored screenshots

3. **Verify Results**:
   ```bash
   aws dynamodb scan --table-name ClassifierStack-TweetTopicsTableD9CB57C4-1A8FFGIVK5AJ2 --query 'Items[0]'
   ```

The service is configured to use the **Gemini API** for LLM operations. 

## Testing Insights and Best Practices

### Key Learnings from End-to-End Testing (June 8, 2025)

Through comprehensive end-to-end testing of the tweet classification pipeline, several critical insights were discovered that will help future developers avoid common pitfalls:

#### 1. **Dependency Management is Critical**
- **Issue**: Transitive dependencies were missing from `requirements.txt`
- **Impact**: Container failed with cascading `ModuleNotFoundError` issues
- **Solution**: Always test Docker images locally first:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm <image> python -m fargate.async_runner
  ```
- **Required additions**:
  - `selenium==4.21.0` (used by visual capture service)
  - `webdriver-manager==4.0.2` (required by selenium)
  - `Pillow==10.3.0` (for image processing, imports as PIL)

#### 2. **Environment Variable Configuration**
- **Issue**: Missing `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` caused `NoRegionError`
- **Solution**: Always set in CDK stack:
  ```python
  "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION": os.environ.get("CDK_DEFAULT_REGION", "us-east-1")
  ```
- **Also required**: `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`

#### 3. **Data Model Consistency**
- **Issue**: Field name mismatches between producer and consumer
- **Examples**:
  - Producer: `metadata_s3_location` vs Consumer: `s3_metadata_path`
  - Metadata: `tweet_metadata.text` vs Expected: `full_text_ocr`
- **Solution**: Always verify data structure with debug logging:
  ```python
  print(f"Metadata structure: {json.dumps(data, indent=2)}")
  ```

#### 4. **API Compatibility**
- **Gemini API Issues**:
  - Temperature must use `generation_config`, not direct parameter
  - Model name updated: `gemini-pro` → `gemini-1.5-flash`
- **Solution**: Test API calls in isolation before integration

#### 5. **Local vs Production Testing**
- **S3 Access**: Need AWS credentials for local testing
- **File Paths**: Handle both S3 URLs and local paths:
  ```python
  if not s3_path.startswith("s3://"):
      # Local file handling
  else:
      # S3 download logic
  ```

### Testing Workflow Best Practices

1. **Always Test Locally First**
   - Build and run Docker container locally
   - Verify no import errors before deployment
   - Test with minimal environment variables

2. **Use Iterative Debugging**
   - Fix one error at a time
   - Rebuild and retest after each fix
   - Document each issue and solution

3. **Monitor All Components**
   - CloudWatch logs for container output
   - SQS queue depth for message processing
   - DynamoDB for final results
   - S3 for screenshot storage

4. **Maintain Data Consistency**
   - Document all data structures
   - Use consistent field naming
   - Validate data at each step

### Quick Testing Commands Reference

```bash
# Local Docker testing
docker build -t test . && docker run --rm test python -m fargate.async_runner

# End-to-end pipeline test
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src:$PYTHONPATH
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --accounts elonmusk --max 5

# Monitor processing
aws logs tail /aws/ecs/<service-name> --follow
aws dynamodb scan --table-name <table> --query 'Items[0]'
```
