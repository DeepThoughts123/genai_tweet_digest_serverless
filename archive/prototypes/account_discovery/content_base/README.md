# Content-Based Account Discovery Implementation

## Overview

This module implements the **Content-Based Discovery Strategy** for finding high-quality GenAI Twitter accounts. Unlike graph-based approaches that rely on network connections, this strategy analyzes the actual content, topics, and expertise indicators in user profiles and tweets.

**Core Principle**: *"Content quality and relevance indicate expertise."*

## üéØ Strategy Components

The content-based discovery system consists of four complementary analysis components:

### 1. Bio and Profile Analysis (`bio_analyzer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Find accounts with GenAI keywords in bios and institutional affiliations
- **Key Features**:
  - Keyword pattern matching across multiple categories (academic, industry, technical)
  - Institutional affiliation detection (universities, tech companies, research labs)
  - Expertise indicator identification (PhD, Professor, Senior roles, etc.)
  - Bio quality assessment and spam detection

### 2. Content Similarity Analysis (`content_similarity.py`)
- **Purpose**: Find accounts whose tweet content is semantically similar to known experts
- **Key Features**:
  - Content profiling of expert accounts
  - Technical sophistication scoring
  - Topic alignment analysis
  - Content quality evaluation based on depth and resource sharing

### 3. Topic and Hashtag Analysis (`topic_analyzer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Identify accounts actively discussing relevant GenAI topics and using appropriate hashtags
- **Key Features**:
  - GenAI hashtag frequency analysis
  - Topic category identification (foundation models, computer vision, NLP, AI safety, etc.)
  - Trend participation assessment
  - Topic authority measurement

### 4. Publication and Link Analysis (`publication_analyzer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Find accounts sharing academic research and high-quality resources
- **Key Features**:
  - Academic domain link detection (arXiv, conference sites, GitHub)
  - Research paper sharing identification
  - Open source contribution tracking
  - Citation and impact indicators

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

```
ContentBasedDiscovery (Main Orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BioAnalyzer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContentSimilarityAnalyzer  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TopicAnalyzer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PublicationAnalyzer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ContentConfig (Configuration)
```

### Main Orchestrator (`content_discovery.py`)

The `ContentBasedDiscovery` class coordinates all analysis components:

1. **Discovery Pipeline**: Runs all four analyzers in parallel
2. **Candidate Merging**: Combines results from different sources
3. **Adaptive Scoring**: Calculates overall scores with intelligent weight redistribution
4. **Quality Filtering**: Applies comprehensive quality filters
5. **Results Export**: Generates detailed analysis reports

## üìä Scoring System

### Component Weights (Default)
- **Bio Analysis**: 25% - Keywords, affiliations, expertise indicators
- **Content Similarity**: 30% - Content quality and similarity to experts (highest weight)
- **Topic Analysis**: 25% - Topic relevance and hashtag usage
- **Publication Analysis**: 20% - Research sharing and academic links

### Adaptive Scoring Logic
When only some analyzers find candidates, weights are automatically redistributed among active sources. For example, if only topic analysis finds a candidate, it receives 100% weight instead of 25%.

### Multi-Source Validation Bonus
Accounts discovered by multiple strategies receive a bonus multiplier:
- 2 sources: +10% bonus
- 3 sources: +20% bonus  
- 4 sources: +30% bonus

## üîß Configuration

The system is highly configurable through `ContentConfig`:

### Key Parameters
```python
# Analysis Thresholds
content_similarity_threshold = 0.3
topic_relevance_threshold = 0.3
publication_score_threshold = 0.3

# Quality Filters
min_overall_score = 0.2
min_followers_content_based = 100

# Search Limits
max_bio_search_results = 1000
max_content_search_results = 500
```

### Keyword Categories
- **GenAI Keywords**: 30+ terms covering AI/ML, model architectures, applications
- **Academic Keywords**: University-related terms, degrees, research roles
- **Industry Keywords**: Professional titles, company roles, seniority levels
- **Technical Keywords**: Methodology and implementation terms

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Discovery
```python
from content_discovery import ContentBasedDiscovery
from content_config import ContentConfig

# Initialize
config = ContentConfig()
discovery = ContentBasedDiscovery(config)

# Run discovery
results = discovery.discover_accounts(
    search_terms=["machine learning", "neural networks"],
    expert_accounts=["AndrewYNg", "karpathy"],
    max_candidates=100
)

print(f"Found {len(results)} candidates")
```

### Individual Component Testing
```python
# Test bio analyzer
from bio_analyzer import BioAnalyzer

analyzer = BioAnalyzer(config)
candidates = analyzer.find_candidates_by_bio(
    keywords=["deep learning", "computer vision"],
    max_results=50
)

# Test topic analyzer  
from topic_analyzer import TopicAnalyzer

topic_analyzer = TopicAnalyzer(config)
topic_candidates = topic_analyzer.find_accounts_by_topics(
    topics=["generative AI", "transformer"],
    max_results=50
)
```

## üìà Expected Results

Based on testing with mock data, the system typically discovers:

### From Each Component
- **Bio Analysis**: Accounts with explicit GenAI expertise in profiles
- **Content Similarity**: Accounts with high-quality technical content
- **Topic Analysis**: Accounts actively discussing GenAI topics
- **Publication Analysis**: Research-oriented accounts sharing academic content

### Quality Distribution
- **High Confidence (0.7+)**: Verified experts with multiple validation sources
- **Medium Confidence (0.4-0.7)**: Practitioners with strong single-source signals
- **Emerging Voices (0.2-0.4)**: New accounts with quality content but limited history

## üîç Quality Assurance

### Multi-Layer Filtering
1. **Score Thresholds**: Each component has minimum score requirements
2. **Account Quality**: Follower count, bio completeness, account age
3. **Spam Detection**: Pattern-based filtering of promotional accounts
4. **Content Quality**: Assessment of discussion depth and resource sharing

### Validation Features
- **Cross-Component Verification**: Higher confidence for multi-source discoveries
- **Institutional Validation**: Bonus for verified affiliations
- **Content Depth Analysis**: Technical sophistication scoring
- **Research Validation**: Academic publication and citation tracking

## üìÅ Output Files

The system generates comprehensive analysis reports:

### `content_candidates.json`

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test individual components
python bio_analyzer.py
python content_similarity.py
python topic_analyzer.py
python publication_analyzer.py

# Test complete system
python content_discovery.py

# Debug mode
python debug_content_discovery.py
```

## üîß Production Considerations

### Real Twitter API Integration
To use with real Twitter API, replace `MockTwitterAPI` in each analyzer:

```python
# Replace mock with real API client
self.twitter_api = TwitterAPIClient(bearer_token=token)
```

### Rate Limiting
The system includes built-in rate limiting considerations:
- **Search requests**: 300 per hour limit
- **API calls**: 15 per 15-minute window
- **Batch processing**: Intelligent queuing for large datasets

### Scalability Features
- **Incremental processing**: Add new candidates without full rerun
- **Caching**: Expert profile caching for repeated analysis
- **Parallel processing**: Component analyzers can run independently
- **Memory efficiency**: Streaming processing for large candidate sets
