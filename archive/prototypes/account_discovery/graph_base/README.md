# GenAI Twitter Account Curation System

## Overview

This system automatically discovers and curates high-quality Twitter accounts in the Generative AI domain. The goal is to build and maintain a dynamic list of 200-300 accounts for regular tweet monitoring and content summarization.

```

## 📁 Current Implementation

### ✅ Step 1.1: Seed Account Tier Assignment (`tier_assignment.py`)
**Purpose**: Classify Twitter accounts into priority tiers based on institutional affiliation and expertise signals.

**Tier Logic**:
- 🎓 **Tier 1**: Academic & Research Institutions (Stanford, MIT, DeepMind, etc.)
- 🏢 **Tier 2**: Major Tech Companies (Google, OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)  
- 🔍 **Tier 3**: GenAI Keywords (2+ AI-related terms in bio)

**Input**: List of Twitter handles  
**Output**: Tiered seed accounts with reasoning

### ✅ Step 1.2: Following List Extraction (`following_extractor.py`)
**Purpose**: Extract and filter the "following" lists from tiered seed accounts to discover new potential accounts.

**Key Features**:
- Smart rate limiting (15 requests per 15 minutes)
- Quality filtering (removes spam, crypto, follow-for-follow accounts)
- Tier-weighted relationship tracking
- JSON export for graph analysis

**Input**: Tiered seed accounts  
**Output**: High-quality following relationships

### ✅ Step 2.1: Graph Construction (`graph_constructor.py`)
**Purpose**: Transform following relationships into a weighted directed graph for network analysis.

**Key Features**:
- Tier-based edge weighting (Tier 1=3.0, Tier 2=2.0, Tier 3=1.0)
- Network metrics calculation (degree, PageRank, centrality)
- Cross-tier validation and overlap analysis
- Multiple export formats (GraphML, JSON)

**Input**: Following relationships JSON  
**Output**: Weighted graph with calculated metrics

### ✅ Step 2.2: Community Detection (`community_detector.py`)
**Purpose**: Identify specialized sub-communities within the GenAI network and find bridge accounts.

**Key Features**:
- Louvain algorithm for community detection
- Bridge account identification (global vs local bridges)
- Community characterization (size, quality, topics)
- Topic inference based on account characteristics

**Input**: Weighted graph from Step 2.1  
**Output**: Communities, bridge accounts, and ecosystem structure

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage:
```python
# Step 1.1: Assign tiers to seed accounts
from tier_assignment import process_seed_handles
seeds = process_seed_handles(["AndrewYNg", "OpenAI", "huggingface"])

# Step 1.2: Extract following relationships  
from following_extractor import FollowingExtractor
extractor = FollowingExtractor()
results = extractor.extract_all_seeds(seeds, max_accounts_per_seed=1000)

# Get summary and save data
summary = extractor.get_relationship_summary()
extractor.save_relationships_to_json("relationships.json")

# Step 2.1: Build weighted graph
from graph_constructor import FollowingGraphConstructor
constructor = FollowingGraphConstructor()
constructor.load_relationships_from_json("relationships.json")
constructor.calculate_basic_metrics()
constructor.calculate_advanced_metrics()

# Generate analysis report
report = constructor.create_summary_report()
print(report)
```

### Expected Output (20 seed accounts):
- **10,000-20,000** raw following relationships extracted
- **5,000-10,000** high-quality relationships after filtering
- **2,000-4,000** unique account candidates discovered
- **200-500** high-signal accounts (followed by multiple seeds)
- **Weighted graph** with tier-based edge weights and network metrics

## 📊 Data Quality & Filtering

### Quality Filters Applied:
- ✅ Minimum follower thresholds (10+ for basic accounts)
- ✅ Spam keyword filtering (crypto, forex, follow-for-follow, etc.)
- ✅ Account age requirements (30+ days)
- ✅ Language filtering (English-focused)
- ✅ Protected/suspended account removal

### Expected Quality Metrics:
- **Verification rate**: 30-50% of discovered accounts
- **Relevance rate**: 80%+ AI/tech related accounts
- **Spam filtered**: 10-20% of raw relationships removed

## ⚙️ Configuration Examples

The system supports multiple configuration profiles in `example_config.py`:

- **Standard**: Balanced approach for general use
- **Strict**: Higher thresholds, more selective curation  
- **Inclusive**: Lower thresholds, broader coverage
- **Safety-Focused**: Optimized for AI safety/ethics coverage
- **Research-Focused**: Optimized for cutting-edge research
- **Industry-Focused**: Optimized for applications/products

## 🔄 API Integration & Rate Limiting

### Twitter API Requirements:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /2/users/by/username/{username}` (Step 1.1)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /2/users/{id}/following` (Step 1.2)
- **Rate Limits**: 15 requests per 15-minute window
- **Fields needed**: `id,name,username,description,public_metrics,verified,created_at,protected`

### Current Implementation:
- Automatic rate limit handling with sleep/retry logic
- Priority processing (Tier 1 seeds first)
- Efficient batching and pagination
- Graceful error handling and recovery

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Processing Time:
- **Step 1.1**: ~1-2 seconds per account (API lookup + tier assignment)
- **Step 1.2**: ~2-3 hours for 20 seeds (rate-limited by Twitter API)
- **Total Pipeline**: ~3-4 hours for complete processing

### Resource Usage:
- **Memory**: ~1MB per 1000 relationships
- **Storage**: JSON output scales linearly (~500KB per seed account)
- **API calls**: ~1-2 calls per seed + following list calls

### Scalability:
- **Current**: Efficiently handles 50 seed accounts
- **Target**: Can scale to 200+ seeds with optimization
- **Bottleneck**: Twitter API rate limits (not computational)

## 🔄 Operational Schedule

### Data Refresh Cycle:
- **Tier assignment**: Re-run when adding new seeds
- **Following extraction**: Every 2 weeks (as relationships change)
- **Filter updates**: Monthly (add new spam patterns, keywords)
- **Configuration review**: Quarterly (adjust thresholds, lists)

### Monitoring Metrics:
- Extraction success rate (target: >95%)
- Filter effectiveness (spam filtered: 10-20%)
- API quota usage (stay within monthly limits)
- Data freshness (relationships <2 weeks old)

3. **Historical**: Validate against known high-quality accounts
4. **Feedback**: Monitor summary quality from discovered accounts

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why This Approach Works:
1. **Graph-based**: Social networks reveal expertise and relevance
2. **Tier weighting**: Prioritizes signals from high-authority accounts  
3. **Quality filtering**: Removes noise while preserving signal
4. **Configurable**: Adapts to different use cases and preferences
5. **Scalable**: Handles large account discovery efficiently

### Advantages Over Alternatives:
- **vs. Keyword Search**: Higher precision, discovers hidden experts
- **vs. Manual Curation**: Scalable, data-driven, less biased
- **vs. Follower-based**: Following patterns reveal more intentional choices
- **vs. Content-only**: Leverages social proof and community structure
